    <h1>Persona</h1>
    <p>Name: Sarah Thompson</p>
    <p>Age: 35</p>
    <p>Role: Talent Acquisition Manager (and occasional Founder-hat wearer) at a 50-person tech startup specializing in SaaS solutions.</p>
    <p>Background: Sarah has a bachelor's degree in Human Resources and 10 years of experience in recruitment, starting in larger corporations before joining the startup world. She's based in a mid-sized city like Austin, TX, and juggles multiple hats due to limited resources-no full HR team, just her and a part-time assistant. She's tech-savvy but not a developer, relying on tools like LinkedIn and ATS systems.</p>
    <p>Goals and Motivations: Sarah aims to build a high-performing team to drive company growth, but she wants to do it efficiently without burning out. She values work-life balance, diversity in hiring, and finding "hidden gems" who might not have perfect resumes but bring unique skills.</p>
    <p>Pain Points: Overwhelmed by administrative tasks like sifting through hundreds of resumes and emails weekly, scheduling interviews manually, and following up with candidates. She fears missing top talent buried in PDFs or unqualified applicants, leading to prolonged vacancies that stall projects.</p>
    <p>Daily Challenges: Starts her day with 50+ new applications, spends hours on initial screens, and ends up with decision fatigue. Limited budget means no fancy recruitment agencies, so she relies on free tools that don't scale well.</p>
    <p>Preferences: Prefers intuitive, AI-powered tools that automate routine work while allowing her to make final judgment calls. She's open to innovation but wary of fully automated systems that might introduce bias.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Small to mid-sized companies (SMEs) in the tech sector face significant inefficiencies in their hiring processes, particularly during the high-volume screening and scheduling phases. Talent acquisition managers like Sarah are inundated with hundreds of resumes for each open role but lack the dedicated HR resources to screen them effectively. This leads to decision fatigue, where recruiters spend excessive time parsing unstructured data from PDFs, emails, and applications, resulting in slow time-to-hire (often exceeding 68 days), poor candidate experiences due to delayed responses, and missed opportunities to secure top talent. Ultimately, these bottlenecks hinder company growth, increase recruitment costs, and contribute to higher turnover as overburdened teams struggle to fill critical positions promptly.</p>

    <h2>Market Research Summary</h2>
    <p>The hiring market for SMEs remains challenging in 2026, characterized by a "low-hire, low-fire" environment with slow job growth and persistent skills shortages. Approximately 74% of employers worldwide report difficulties in finding skilled talent, exacerbating vacancies in tech and professional services. In the U.S., private-sector hiring has slowed, with mid-sized companies adding only 41,000 jobs in early 2026, while sectors like professional services saw losses of 57,000 positions. One in three SMEs struggles to fill roles, with half facing long-standing vacancies that impede expansion. Time-to-hire has risen 22% to a median of 68.5 days, straining resources and allowing competitors to snatch candidates-52% of companies report challenges in hiring before rivals do. Budget constraints further complicate matters, as many SMEs overspend on traditional agencies without scalable solutions.</p>
